## Description

_Game Rules:
Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":_
* _The program allows the users to roll their dice or hold per turn._
* _If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn._
* _If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues._
* _If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
The first player to score 100 or more points wins._

Example:
|Input|Output|
|---|---|
| User rolls the die and get 5 points| 5 added to round score, user continues to play|
| User rolls the die and get 1 point| User looses the score for that round, next player's turn|
| User chooses to hold| User's score is added to the total score, next user's turn|

* If the player rolls a 5, they score 5 points to their score in that current round. If they choose to roll again and get a number above one, that number is added to their score.
* If they player rolls a 1, then they score nothing for that round and it becomes the next player's turn.
